# Divvy-Data-Analysis

The goal of this project was to create a R-markdown file that performs an alaysis on the divvy-bike rental company and weather patterns in chicago. 
This was accomplished by using python for the data wrangling of two data-sets, NOAA weather data and divvy-bike-rentals. This repository contains the
data-wrangling work required to get the two datasets to agree with one another. All the work was done in python. For the ipyb files please go to the
